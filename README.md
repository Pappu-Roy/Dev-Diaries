Dev Diaries

üöÄ Overview
This is a Dev Diaries application built from scratch to showcase foundational full-stack web development skills. It features a public-facing blog and a secure admin panel for managing posts. This project is a great demonstration of how to build a complete web application with a dynamic backend and a responsive frontend.

‚ú® Features
Public Blog: Displays a list of all blog posts with summaries.

Admin Panel: A secure login system for an administrator.

CRUD Operations: The admin can Create, Read, Update, and Delete posts.

Post Categories: Posts can be categorized (e.g., Science, Technology, Programming, News) with a dynamic dropdown menu in the navbar.

Rich Text Editor: The admin panel uses TinyMCE for creating formatted blog posts.

Reusable Components: The application uses a central header.php and footer.php for consistent design and maintainable code.

Responsive UI: A modern and attractive design built with Tailwind CSS that works on all devices.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
